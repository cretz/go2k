* General code refactoring and cleanup
  * The places where things are coerced and unfurled are confusing, fix
* Change the wrapper classes to include all of their own operators and the like
* Make variadic methods be overloads to create slices
* Be smarter about naming wrt imports and clashes (i.e. either contextual state, ahead-of-time ident capture, or after-the-fact optimizer)
